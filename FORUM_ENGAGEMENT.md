### Template 1: Initial Introduction Post

**Title**: "Introducing OPM: Object Placement Manager for UE5 - Free & Open Source Level Design Tool"

**Body**:
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on a plugin to solve a problem I kept running into: spending way too much time on repetitive object placement and organization in my levels.

**What is OPM?**
Object Placement Manager is an open-source Unreal Engine 5 plugin that streamlines level design workflows. It's completely free and available on GitHub.

**Key Features:**
✓ Batch object placement (grid, circular, linear, random patterns)
✓ Smart alignment & distribution tools
✓ Batch naming utilities with auto-numbering
✓ Quick actor replacement (preserves transforms)
✓ Level organization and hierarchy tools
✓ Full undo/redo support
✓ Clean Editor Utility Widget interface

**Why I Built This:**
After researching the marketplace, I noticed a gap: simple, focused workflow tools that save time without overwhelming complexity. Most solutions are either too expensive, too complicated, or poorly documented.

**Current Status:**
The core C++ utilities are complete and tested. I'm currently working on the Editor Utility Widget UI to make everything accessible and intuitive.

**GitHub Repository:**
https://github.com/Mittenzx/OPM

**I'd Love Your Feedback:**
- What placement/organization tasks take up most of your time?
- What features would be most valuable to you?
- Would you find this useful in your workflow?

Feel free to star the repo if you're interested, and don't hesitate to open issues with feature requests or bugs you encounter!

Thanks for reading! 🚀
```

### Template 2: Feature Showcase Post

**Title**: "OPM Feature Spotlight: Batch Placement Patterns [Video/GIF]"

**Body**:
```
Quick demo of Object Placement Manager's batch placement patterns! 

[Insert GIF or Video here]

In this example, I placed 50 columns in a circular pattern in under 10 seconds. This would typically take several minutes manually.

**Available Patterns:**
- Grid: Perfect rows and columns
- Circular: Objects around a center point
- Linear: Along a straight line
- Random: Scatter within bounds

All patterns support:
- Customizable spacing
- Rotation variations
- Real-time preview
- Full undo support

The plugin is free and open source on GitHub: https://github.com/Mittenzx/OPM

What placement patterns would you like to see added? I'm actively taking suggestions!
```

### Template 3: Seeking Feedback Post

**Title**: "Level Designers: What Repetitive Tasks Waste Your Time?"

**Body**:
```
Hey fellow level designers! 👋

I'm building an open-source workflow tool (Object Placement Manager) for UE5, and I want to make sure it solves real problems you face every day.

**Quick Survey:**
1. What repetitive level design tasks eat up most of your time?

3. What's the most frustrating part of organizing large levels?

**What OPM Currently Offers:**

The roadmap is community-driven. If there's something you need, let me know and I'll prioritize it!
