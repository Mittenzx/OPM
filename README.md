## 🎯 Project Overview

Object Placement Manager (OPM) is a professional-grade Unreal Engine editor plugin designed to streamline level design workflows. This project was created to fill a specific market gap identified through research of the Fab marketplace: **simple, focused workflow automation tools that are missing or poorly developed**.

### Market Opportunity

After analyzing developer needs and marketplace gaps, we identified that:
- Workflow automation tools are consistently requested but poorly served
- Developers spend hours on repetitive placement and organization tasks
- Existing solutions are either too complex, too expensive, or poorly documented
- Small teams and solo developers need affordable, easy-to-use tools

**OPM addresses these needs with a focused, well-designed solution.**

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality

1. **Batch Object Placement**
   - Grid, circular, linear, and random patterns

   - Even distribution (horizontal, vertical, radial)
   - Snap to grid and surface normals

3. **Batch Naming Utilities**
   - Add prefixes/suffixes
   - Auto-numbering with custom formats
   - Find and replace operations
   - Naming convention templates

4. **Quick Actor Replacement**

   - Maintain hierarchy and relationships
   - Support for all actor types

5. **Level Organization Tools**
   - Auto-grouping and hierarchy creation
